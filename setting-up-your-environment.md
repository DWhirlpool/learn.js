# Setting Up Your Environment

### You Will Need A Couple Of Tools <a href="#what_tools_do_the_professionals_use" id="what_tools_do_the_professionals_use"></a>

That looks like a scary list, but fortunately, you can get started in web development without knowing anything about most of these. In this article, we'll just set you up with a bare minimum â€” a text editor and some modern web browsers.

#### Installing a text editor <a href="#installing_a_text_editor" id="installing_a_text_editor"></a>

You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\_Notepad) and macOS comes with [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit). Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with [gedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit) by default.

For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints, [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

#### Installing modern web browsers <a href="#installing_modern_web_browsers" id="installing_modern_web_browsers"></a>

For now, we'll install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click the relevant links to download installers for your favorite browsers:

* Linux: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Brave](https://brave.com/).
* Windows: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/internet-explorer-downloads-d49e1f0d-571c-9a7b-d97e-be248806ca70), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), [Brave](https://brave.com/) (Windows 10 comes with Edge by default; if you have Windows 7 or above, you can install Internet Explorer 11; otherwise, you should install an alternative browser).
* macOS: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Brave](https://brave.com/) (macOS and iOS come with Safari by default).

Before going on, you should install at least two of these browsers and have them ready for testing.

#### Installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Optional)

Even though you might not want to install this, it is highly recommended to install Node.js as it will be very useful to you in the future and you will be using it to install modules.

### If You Don't Want To Install To Much

You might be low on storage space, so you might not want to install so much tools so I recommend you to try out [Gitpod](http://gitpod.io/), which is a cloud development environment that has most of the tools a developer would need, [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), [github.dev](https://github.dev), [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/), [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/), [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
