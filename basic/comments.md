# Comments

Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:

```
/*
Everything in between is a comment.
*/
```

If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:

```
// This is a comment
```
